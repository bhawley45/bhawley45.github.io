New website design (#3)
8-bit adventure/RPG themed
Dark/cool background for site

Console:
Add Stickers for W101 and Destiny
Add "Brandon's" in soft color (like drawn on)

Extra:
my pixel art guy pops up from the bottom left, says hello and introduces, and instructs the user how to use the site (maybe different text for each section?)
Audio for button clicks and background music for each project page?

Make L/R buttons A and B on a NES controller

Make Social Links pixelated and monochromatic

Top toolbar:
Centered
Always shown, always on top
Slightly darker/lighter than BG
Home, About, Resume, Contact
Darken the section the user is in

Hero Section:
Animated console(top-loader) sliding up from bottom of window on page load
Games fall from top and do 1 wave on load
On hover, games get larger and push the others out (soft white background)
Game Cartridge unique decals for each game with title (~match NES)
On click, screen goes black (Out->In) then (In->Out) on project specific page

About section:
My image on the left (towards the top)
My image is updated (linked in Profile Image), do the same code thing with the face
Text on the right
Unified text section below with horizontal bullet points or something to show highlighted skills and experience

Resume:
arcade machine that says “insert coin for resume”
On click: plays animation of coin going in (with sound?) and opens resume .pdf in another tab on the users browser

Contact:
just a simple form that goes to my email
