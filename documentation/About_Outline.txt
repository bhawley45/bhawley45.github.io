Hello, I'm Brandon Hawley, a dedicated father and game developer with over six years of experience in software development. As a kid, I was fascinated by gaming; my imagination would run wild with fantastic stories and worlds. I filled journals with sketches, references, and writings until their bindings fell apart. But as time went on, I lost faith that my dreams were possible. I started at MCC pursuing an associate's in Electrical Engineering, lured by the promise of financial stability, but I quickly realized it was not a good fit.

I switched to Computer Science and started fresh at Missouri Western. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic began disrupting everything, I realized I was essentially paying for a self-directed education. This led me to rethink my approach. I got married and founded Hawleywood Electronics LLC to support my family, teaching myself software development on the side. Life was good, albeit it hectic - until it wasn't. As the business grew, it began to consume all my time and energy, leaving nothing left for my family or my dreams. 

Then our world suddenly shattered... We lost our 9-month-old son in December of 2020. Losing him was unimaginable, bringing our lives to a screeching halt. My commitment to Hawleywood Electronics had stolen time from my family that I will never get back, spent on something I didn't even enjoy. I closed my business and entered a season of soul-searching.

The arrival of our second son brought new hope and renewed purpose. It was then that I fully embraced my childhood dream of creating games, resolving no longer to sideline the passions that had ignited my imagination. Life is too short not to pursue your dreams. This shift has not only brought fulfillment but has also allowed me to be more present with my family. I'm not overwhelmed by work and can provide a stable, loving environment with a consistent schedule. 

I decided to take a more structured path into Game Dev. I enrolled in a game development bootcamp. There, I learned the foundations of both software and game development, project management, and teamwork. The program included practical experience, culminating in an internship at Prosper IT Consulting.

Now, I balance being a father with my rekindled pursuit of game development. Each project is more than just a game; it's a piece of my personal revival and a testament to the resilience required to follow one's dreams amid lifeâ€™s unpredictability.
